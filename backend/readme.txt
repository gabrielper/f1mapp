There are two programs to run the backend (I'm using  screen to run them from this folder):
- live-f1: It's a C program modified to generate a json with the data
	You need to untar and compile the live-f1-f1mapp.tgz in this folder and then run it:
	screen ./live-f1-f1mapp/src/live-f1
- nodejs: It's a websocket server to serve the json file generated by the live-f1 program
	screen nodejs node-f1mapp/index.js
